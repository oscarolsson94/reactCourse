- React is a JavaScript library.

- Usually called a "framework".

- Used to build front-end apps.

- Allows user-interaction at a new level.

------------

- Components can have a "state", which is an obkect that determines how
  that component renders and behaves.

- We can also have "application level" state by using a "state manager"
  like Redux or Reacts own conext API.

  State object:

  state = {
    title: 'xxx',
    body: 'xxx',
    isFeatured: true
  }
